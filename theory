 🧠 Theoretical Foundations

This bibliography represents the foundational literature informing The Vine Project's approach to AI architecture.

Our work draws on established research in curiosity-driven learning, pattern recognition, animal cognition, and geometric approaches to computation.

 🌿 Core Thesis:  
 AI systems can move beyond purely associative learning toward intrinsic exploration and conceptual understanding through mathematical constraint, rather than loss-based optimization.
