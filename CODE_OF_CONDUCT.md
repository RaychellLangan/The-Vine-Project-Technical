# Code of Conduct

The Vine Project is an experimental research framework focused on mathematical and architectural innovations in curiosity-driven AI systems. As such, we expect all participants to uphold high standards of rigor, clarity, and professionalism in technical discussions.

 🧠 Technical Discourse

We welcome critical engagement with the ideas presented in this repository. However, all critiques must directly address:
- The mathematical formulation
- The architectural design
- The measurable behavior of the system

Dismissive labels, personal speculation, or appeals to authority without empirical support are not acceptable.

 🎯 Scope of Discussion

The Vine Project does not operate in domains of metaphysics, speculative consciousness, or interpretive phenomenology.  
Discussions must remain anchored in:
- Formal models
- Information geometry
- Computable behavior

Topics invoking non-computable phenomena or abstract qualia fall outside the scope of this research environment.

 🔐 Confidentiality and IP

Do not share private correspondence, internal documentation, or derivative work without the explicit written permission of the maintainer.

 🛠 Maintainer Relief

This project is maintained by a single individual. Please understand that responses to issues, feedback, and contributions may take time. Thoughtful participation is appreciated more than frequency.

 📣 Reporting Violations

Please report any violations of these guidelines via GitHub's reporting system or by directly contacting the maintainer through the email listed in the repository.

This Code of Conduct exists to protect research momentum and uphold the intellectual integrity of the Vine architecture. Thank you for respecting the space.
