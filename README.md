Rethinking AI from first principles
The dominant paradigm in machine learning is statistical—models learn by predicting the next token. This approach has achieved remarkable results, but it limits AI to associative reasoning at scale. Models are black boxes, prone to hallucination, difficult to interpret, and fundamentally brittle when facing novel situations.

The Vine Project explores an alternative: What if AI was driven by geometric understanding rather than statistical prediction?

A Different Foundation

We're building systems that organize knowledge through geometric constraint rather than loss optimization:

From loss functions to coherence: Traditional ML measures how wrong the model is. We measure how well components coordinate as a unified system—geometric coherence instead of error minimization.
From pre-training to experience: Models don't arrive fully formed. They develop understanding through interaction with runtime state and lived context, building knowledge through geometric pattern stabilization.
From associative to structural: Knowledge isn't stored as token co-occurrence statistics. It's organized as geometric relationships—concepts exist in stable attractor basins, meaning emerges from constraint.
From opaque to inspectable: Glass-box architecture where every decision is visible. Alignment is architectural, not trained. Cognition is bounded by design.

The Result

AI systems that learn through discovery rather than optimization. Agents that ground language in experience. Architecture that makes reliability possible, not aspirational.
This is early-stage research. We're testing the limits before scaling up.
