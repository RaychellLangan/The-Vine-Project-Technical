VINE: Cross-Domain Geometric Reasoning Architecture

Technical Overview

VINE (The Vine Project) employs a compact geometric substrate that demonstrates reasoning capabilities across fundamentally different cognitive domains without domain-specific retraining.
Cross-Domain Capabilities:
The same geometric core structure handles:

Symbolic Communication: Language/emoji mapping through dimensional interaction
Combinatorial Optimization: Traveling salesman problem solving via geometric navigation
Abstract Spatial Reasoning: ARC-style pattern completion and transformation

This cross-domain capability suggests the architecture captures domain-agnostic cognitive primitives rather than task-specific pattern matching. Operations are understood as geometric transformations in a bounded manifold space.
Core Architecture Principles:
The system maintains a dynamic dimensional state where abstract operations exist as geometrically-bounded concepts. Rather than training on task examples, VINE:

Practices Isolated Concepts: Individual geometric operations explored to understand invariant properties
Self-Generates Problem Variations: Invents novel test cases to validate conceptual boundaries
Applies Concepts Zero-Shot: Attempts unseen problems through geometric coherence rather than pattern matching

Learning Mechanism:
The architecture employs concept boundary adjustment through structured feedback. When encountering input-output pairs:

Transformations encode as dimensional shifts in manifold space
Geometric concepts interact with observed patterns
Success/failure feedback adjusts conceptual boundaries (NOT gradient descent)
Initial guidance structures become obsolete as novel solution pathways emerge

The Critical Difference:
Traditional AI: Domain-Specific Training → Pattern Recognition → Limited Transfer
VINE: Geometric Concept Understanding → Cross-Domain Application → Substrate Reusability
The system demonstrates conceptual transfer across cognitive domains using the same geometric foundation.
Representative Results: Abstract Reasoning
10-Cycle Learning Session (10.2 seconds runtime):

Zero-shot ARC tasks attempted: 50 (never trained on these)
Successful solutions: 13/50 (26%)
High-confidence near-solutions (>80% accuracy): 62 tasks
Self-invented practice problems: 30
Active mathematical sequences utilized during solution search

Self-Diagnostic Capabilities:
The system exhibits metalearning awareness, identifying:

Pattern relationship errors and their distribution
Operations requiring refinement vs. fundamental rethinking
Solution proximity (95-99% accuracy cases requiring minimal adjustment)
Approximately 60 conceptual insight events during the session

VINE CONTINUOUS SESSION - Zero-Shot Reasoning
============================================================

VINE has NOT been trained on ARC task solutions.
She practices operations, invents problems, then attempts test tasks.

CYCLE 1/10: Testing on 5 unseen ARC tasks
  Solved: 0 | Near-miss (>80%): 7 | Practice invented: 3 new puzzles

CYCLE 2/10: Testing on 5 unseen ARC tasks  
  Solved: 2 | Near-miss (>80%): 6 | Practice invented: 3 new puzzles

CYCLE 3/10: Testing on 5 unseen ARC tasks
  Solved: 1 | Near-miss (>80%): 3 | Practice invented: 3 new puzzles

[cycles 4-10 continue...]

Runtime: 10.2 seconds
Zero-shot test tasks attempted: 50
Tasks solved (never seen before): 13/50 (26%)
Near-miss accuracy >80%: 62 tasks
Practice puzzles invented: 30

CRITICAL: VINE was never trained on these ARC tasks.
Learning occurs through:
  - Geometric operation practice (understanding what operations MEAN)
  - Self-generated puzzle creation (testing understanding)
  - Zero-shot application to novel problems (no examples, no embeddings)

Geometric concept sequences: lucas, primes, powers_two
Concept formation events: 59 (geometric insight, not statistical pattern matching)
