Autonomous Homeostasis via Geometric XOR Resolution
Technical White Paper | Level 13 Analysis (Project VINE)

1. Abstract
The evolution of cognitive architectures often relies on increasing parameter density to approximate survival heuristics. This paper presents an alternative: Structural Homeostasis. In the Level 13 (Shelter) experiment, we demonstrate an agent’s transition from object permanence to environmental coping by resolving multi-variate "concerns" through geometric convergence. By eschewing reinforcement learning (RL) and traditional hidden-layer architectures, the system identifies stable environmental basins using a Zero-Weight logic core.

2. The Mechanics of Environmental Entropy
In this framework, the environment is modeled not as a set of features, but as a Topological Cost Surface.

Entropy Injection: A stochastic "Storm" signal introduces a non-linear metabolic drain, tripling the energy decay rate of the agent upon exposure.

The Geometric XOR: The agent must resolve two conflicting states: the drive for metabolic preservation versus the kinetic cost of environmental exposure.

The Spiral Resolution: The delta between the agent's current state and its metabolic "Safe Harbor" is resolved via the Spiral Learning Operation. This operation functions as a fundamental geometric transducer, mapping raw environmental entropy directly into a navigation vector toward a coordinate of lower entropy.

3. Behavioral Emergence: The Value-Lock Phenomenon
The primary validation of this architecture is the observed Persistence of Residency during low-entropy (Calm) cycles.

Steady-State Residency: Telemetry indicates that the agent maintains its position within the shelter even after the external stimulus (the Storm) has ceased.

Structural Alignment: This is not a product of "memory" in the traditional sense, but a Manifold Alignment. The shelter_protects confidence value strengthens during calm periods because the shelter coordinate remains the global minimum for energy recovery and fatigue reduction.

Mathematical Inevitability: The "belief" in the shelter is a mathematical byproduct of the agent’s internal state synchronizing with the physical topology of the world. The agent is effectively "locked" into the basin of highest stability.

4. Engineering Implications: The Glass Box
The VINE core demonstrates that complex biological behaviors—seeking refuge, resting during adversity, and prioritizing safety—can emerge from a Zero-Weight architecture.

Elimination of Hallucination: By removing RNN/Transformer hidden layers, we eliminate the "black box" of weights. There is no probability; there is only convergence.

Computational Efficiency: Complex survival logic is executed through pure mathematical resolution, allowing for high-fidelity agent behavior within minimal compute constraints.

The Biological Mirror: While an external observer may interpret the agent’s behavior as "seeking comfort", the engineering reality is a transparent, predictable resolution of a Geometric XOR.

Concluding Note: Level 13 results demonstrate that high-order behavioral alignment can be achieved through structural coupling rather than parameter expansion. By treating the environment as a solvable geometry, we have effectively transitioned from stochastic weight-dependency to a deterministic topological relationship between the agent and its operational space.
